# How to contribute

## Support
If you need help getting ani-cli to work, please use the support channel in our [discord](https://discord.gg/aqu7GpqVmR)

## Issues
An issue template is in the works, tldr:
- What is the problem?
- Are you using the latest version?
- What OS are you on?
- With what anime did you encounter the problem?
- Can you reproduce it with another anime?
- What is the output?

## Testing
Our parsing was broken in the past and it will break in the future

To spot breakage early, test with the following anime:
- The safe bet: `One Piece`
- Episode 5.5: `arifureta shokugyou de sekai saiku`
- Unicode: `Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata â™­`
- Unreleased: `boku-no-hero-academia-the-movie-3`

Test automation ideas welcome
